    Each agent interacts with the environment (as defined by the `Env` class) by first observing the
    state of the environment. Based on this observation the agent changes the environment by performing
    an action.

    Do not use this abstract base class directly but instead use one of the concrete agents implemented.
    Each agent realizes a reinforcement learning algorithm. Since all agents conform to the same
    interface, you can use them interchangeably.

    To implement your own agent, you have to implement the following methods:

    - `forward`
    - `backward`
    - `compile`
    - `load_weights`
    - `save_weights`
    - `layers`

            training (boolean): Whether to train or test the agent
            action_repetition (integer): Number of times the agent repeats the same action without
                observing the environment again. Setting this to a value > 1 can be useful
                if a single action only has a very small effect on the environment.
            callbacks (list of `keras.callbacks.Callback` or `rl.callbacks.Callback` instances):
                List of callbacks to apply during training. See [callbacks](/callbacks) for details.
            verbose (integer): 0 for no logging, 1 for interval logging (compare `log_interval`), 2 for episode logging
            visualize (boolean): If `True`, the environment is visualized during training. However,
                this is likely going to slow down training significantly and is thus intended to be
                a debugging instrument.
            nb_max_start_steps (integer): Number of maximum steps that the agent performs at the beginning
                of each episode using `start_step_policy`. Notice that this is an upper limit since
                the exact number of steps to be performed is sampled uniformly from [0, max_start_steps]
                at the beginning of each episode.
            start_step_policy (`lambda observation: action`): The policy
                to follow if `nb_max_start_steps` > 0. If set to `None`, a random action is performed.
            log_interval (integer): If `verbose` = 1, the number of steps that are considered to be an interval.
            nb_max_episode_steps (integer): Number of steps per episode that the agent performs before
                automatically resetting the environment. Set to `None` if each episode should run
                (potentially indefinitely) until the environment signals a terminal state.
            reward_scaling (float): The amount with which the reward will be scaled
